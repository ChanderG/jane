# Jane

A WIP Lisp dialect written in Janet.

## About the language

Will document the language when it gets enough shape. Right now adding features on a whim.

I started out with Norvig's first version [lispy](https://norvig.com/lispy.html) for what it's worth. 

## Why Janet?

It's a simple, lightweight Lisp. Why not? I wanted the first version of the interpreter to be in a Lisp and I simply picked this one.

## Running

Run a Repl directly:
```
./jane/jane
```
Needs a recent Janet installed on your machine.

Running a script:
```
./jane/jane <path to jane script>
```
Working examples can be found in the `examples/` directory.
